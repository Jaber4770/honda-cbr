        <h1 class="header-f-size text-color text-center">4 road rules for driving with motorcycles</h1>
        <p class="text-center">
          “Look twice, save a life” isn’t just a slogan—it’s solid advice. While safety should always be the main concern whenever you’re driving, when automobiles and motorcycles begin to share the road in warmer months, it’s a good idea to be extra vigilant.

          Remember, motorcycles are vehicles with the same rights and privileges as any vehicle on the roadway. It’s important for motorists to understand the safety challenges faced by motorcyclists, such as size, visibility and motorcycle riding practices, to know how to best respond to them.

          Whether you’re the one operating the automobile or the motorcycle, check out our 10 tips for sharing the road to make sure everyone makes it to their destination safely.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-color">1. Share the road, not the lane.</h2>
        <p>Although it may look like there’s enough room in a single lane for both an automobile and a motorcycle, remember the motorcycle needs the room to maneuver safely. Give the motorcyclist some space and don’t share the lane.</p>

        <h2 class="text-color">2. Increase your following distance for flashing turn signals.</h2>
        <p>Self-cancelling turn signals didn’t become standard on motorcycles until the 1970s, and there are still a lot of motorcycles on the road today without them. When you see a flashing turn signal on a motorcycle, wait to be sure the motorcycle is going to turn before you attempt to pass it. If you notice that a motorcyclist has been driving with the turn signal on for a while, increase your following distance so that if it does turn, you’ll have enough time to react.</p>

        <h2 class="text-color">3. A minor annoyance to a motorist could be a major hazard to a motorcyclist.</h2>
        <p>Motorcyclists may change speed or adjust their position within a lane suddenly in reaction to road and traffic conditions, such as potholes, gravel, wet or slippery surfaces, pavement seams, railroad crossings and grooved pavement.</p>

        <h2 class="text-color">4. Remember that motorcycles react differently.</h2>
        <p>Did you know that in dry conditions motorcycles can stop more quickly than cars? Allow more following distance so you have enough time to react in case the motorcycle makes a sudden stop since rear-ending a motorcycle can be fatal to the rider.</p>

              <h3>Biography of Giacomo Agostini</h3>
              <p>
                He was born the son of a wealthy industrialist who at first strongly opposed his intention to compete in motorcycle racing. However, he later received his father's permission and in 1963 he won the Italian 175cc class championship for the Moto Morini team. In 1964 he won the Italian 350cc class championship, and achieved fourth place in his first appearance at the Italian Grand Prix. Due to these results, he transferred to the MV Agusta team, and already in 1965 he was fighting for the title of world champion in the 350cc and 500cc classes. Since 1965 he has been the first driver of the Agusta, winning seven consecutive titles in the 500cc and 350cc classes and the Isle of Man TT race 10 times.. In 1972, he shocked the world of motorcycling when he stated that because of the dangerous track he would no longer run on the Isle of Man TT, which was then the most prestigious race on the calendar. Agostini kept his word, and in the following years other drivers boycotted the race as well. In 1977, it was definitely excluded from the calendar.
